Answer:
if you have millions of products and services, it's inefficient and impractical to dump everything into the prompt. Instead, you should use LangChain as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, where:

User sends a message.

LangChain fetches only the relevant information (e.g. matching FAQs, products, or services from the DB).

LangChain builds a dynamic prompt using that info.

It sends that condensed, relevant context to ChatGPT or Gemini.

You return the response to the user.
