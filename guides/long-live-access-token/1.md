Automated Long-Lived Page Token Acquisition in DRF
This guide outlines the backend logic for a custom DRF endpoint that automates the Facebook token exchange process.

1. The Overall Workflow
Frontend Action: A user logs in via a Facebook button on your frontend (e.g., a simple HTML page or a React component). This grants your app a short-lived user access token.

Frontend API Call: The frontend sends this short-lived token to your custom DRF API endpoint.

Backend Logic (Your DRF View): Your DRF view handles all the heavy lifting:
a.  It receives the short-lived token.
b.  It makes a server-side call to Facebook to exchange the short-lived token for a long-lived user access token (using your APP_ID and APP_SECRET).
c.  It then uses that long-lived user token to make a second server-side call to get the long-lived page access token.
d.  It extracts the required Page Access Token from the response.

Backend Response: Your DRF view returns the final long-lived page token to the frontend.
