## TODO for production

### 1. change channels layer settings in settings.py to

```python
CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer",
        "CONFIG": {
            "hosts": [("127.0.0.1", 6379)],
        },
    },
}
```

## add frontend domains in settings.py ALLOWED_HOSTS and ALLOWED_FRONTEND_DOMAINS

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    'localhost',
    '4b4f-37-111-227-60.ngrok-free.app', # temporary for testing webhook
    '127.0.0.1',
]

# this is for multiple frontend single backend activation link sent in email , activation link need to fronetned domain
# 
ALLOWED_FRONTEND_DOMAINS = [
    'rateteach.ru.ac.bd',
    'localhost:3000',  # for development
    # add other allowed frontend domains
]
```
