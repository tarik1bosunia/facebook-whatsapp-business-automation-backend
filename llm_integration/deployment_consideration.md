# Deployment Considerations

## 🔍 Vector Search
For better FAQ matching, consider integrating `pgvector` with your PostgreSQL database. This enables efficient **semantic similarity search**, which is critical when matching customer messages to relevant FAQs or documents.

## 🚦 Rate Limiting
Implement API rate limiting to **prevent abuse** and ensure fair usage. Use tools like:

- Django: [`django-ratelimit`](https://pypi.org/project/django-ratelimit/)
- DRF: [`drf-extensions` or custom throttling](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/throttling/)

## ⚡ Response Caching
Cache common queries and LLM responses to:

- Improve performance
- Reduce redundant calls to language models
- Lower operational costs

Use Django cache backends like Redis or Memcached.

## 📊 Analytics
Track:

- **Response quality**
- **User feedback**
- **Query patterns**

This helps improve model accuracy, measure performance, and refine prompt engineering strategies.

## ✅ Testing
Ensure **comprehensive testing** across components:

- Unit tests for logic and utilities
- Integration tests for DB and API endpoints
- WebSocket connection tests
- Prompt formatting and LLM response handling

Use tools like `pytest`, `factory_boy`, and Django’s test framework.
